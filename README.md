# <!DOCTYPE> in html

The <!DOCTYPE> declaration is used in HTML to define the document type and HTML version the browser should render. It helps ensure that web pages are displayed consistently across different browsers by triggering standards mode, which means the browser will render the page according to the HTML and CSS specifications. Here's an overview of its usage and types:

# example

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <head>
        <title>Page Title</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    </body>
    </html>

# <meta> tag in html

The <meta> tag in HTML is used to provide metadata about the HTML document. Metadata is information about the data, and it is typically used to specify the character set, page description, keywords, author of the document, and viewport settings. Metadata is not displayed on the page but is used by browsers, search engines, and other web services.

# example

    <!DOCTYPE html>

    <html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
        <meta name="description" content="A comprehensive guide to HTML meta tags.">
        <meta name="keywords" content="HTML, meta tags, web development, SEO">
        <meta name="author" content="John Doe">
        <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
        <title>Understanding HTML Meta Tags</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Welcome to the Guide on HTML Meta Tags</h1>
    </body>
    </html>
